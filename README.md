# 3D Graphics Programming in C++


This project is developed using C++, and it revolves around a narrative of a man walking down a street. As he strolls, he encounters a moving object that piques his curiosity. However, instead of approaching it, he decides to turn back and retrace his steps, creating a loop in his journey. This loop symbolizes the themes of hesitation and exploration, illustrating how unexpected encounters can lead to introspection and a change in direction.

The project not only showcases the basic functionality of a loop in programming but also serves as a metaphor for life's unpredictable nature and the choices we make in response to them.
